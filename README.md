# Got-You-Chrome-Ext.
Want to do justice to those pesky little runts at the office that keep leaving pranks on your work computer while you're out for lunch?
Well say no more friend, this app will help you catch them in the act. They will think twice before messing with you next time.

##How To Use
* When the extension is first fired, there will be some instructions and input fields to enter an email and a password. This is necessary because the extension will connect to the user's email account. If the user has already done this step before, they can click on "Use same crendentials", and the extension will fetch the credentials used last from HTML5 local storage.
